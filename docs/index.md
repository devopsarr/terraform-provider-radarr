# Radarr Provider

The Radarr provider is used to interact with any [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) installation. You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it. Use the left navigation to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "radarr" {
  url     = "http://example.radarr.tv:8989"
  api_key = "APIkey-example"
  extra_headers = [
    {
      name  = "exampleName"
      value = "exanpleValue"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for Radarr authentication. Can be specified via the `RADARR_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `extra_headers` (Attributes Set) Extra headers to be sent along with all Radarr requests. If this attribute is unset, it can be specified via environment variables following this pattern `RADARR_EXTRA_HEADER_${Header-Name}=${Header-Value}`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--extra_headers))
- `url` (String) Full Radarr URL with protocol and port (e.g. `https://test.radarr.tv:7878`). You should **NOT** supply any path (`/api`), the SDK will use the appropriate paths. Can be specified via the `RADARR_URL` environment variable.
